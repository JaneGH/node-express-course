1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
    Middleware in an Express application is like a helper that processes requests before they reach your main code.
    It can do things like authentication or data validation to keep your application running smoothly.

2. What does CRUD stand for?
    CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. 
    It's the basic set of operations you can do with data: making new entries, seeing what's there, changing what exists,
    and removing things when you don't need them anymore


3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
        Install dotenv package using npm or yarn (npm install dotenv or yarn add dotenv),
        then require it at the beginning ofmain application file like this:
            require('dotenv').config();
        After this, you can access your environment variables (stored in the .env file) using process.env.VARIABLE_NAME
        wherever you need them in your application code.

    2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
        Add .env to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being tracked by Git.
